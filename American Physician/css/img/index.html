   	  <h1>The Pass Machine – The Power Behind this Learning System</h1>
      <p>Dear Colleague,</p>
      <p>How is The Pass Machine course able to offer such an exceptional guarantee? The answer is that this integrated, comprehensive, and high-yield review course works. What is its secret? It is both systematic and flexible. For instance, the course is available NOW, so you can start studying today. And also, you maintain long-term access to all course materials - in this case, through the end of 2013. This allows a focused review of the material without the stress of looming deadlines. </p>
	  <p>The Pass Machine course includes three parts that work together in harmony to build your understanding and retention of the exam material. The goal? That you not only pass your exam, but that you pass it the first time.</p>

            <p>"All speakers are #1 in their topics; the course is very complete and gives extra-super tips to pass the exam. I would recommend all my peers to take The Pass Machine Family Medicine course!"

       	  <h2>Part 1: Laser Focused Lectures</h2>
			<p><strong>High-Yield Review:</strong> Course lecture topics strictly follow the ABFM exam content blueprint and are medically edited by knowledgeable, board-certified physicians. This focused approach ensures that you study only the specific areas tested on your family medicine exam and nothing else. With such a massive amount of knowledge to review for the exam, a laser focus on relevant content is key to completing – not just starting – your review. </p>
			<p><strong>Two Ways to View:</strong> You receive course lecture access both as streaming video that you view on your laptop or tablet computer, including the iPad®, and as mobile video you can view on your smartphone. This double access provides unprecedented flexibility so you can use spare minutes during breaks and between patients to review course materials. Lectures can be paused and restarted, and viewed in any order and as many times as you like. This online access is available all the way through the end of 2013! Plus, if you choose the option to attend live lectures, you'll benefit from five days of focused immersion and the camaraderie of studying with your colleagues.</p>
			<p><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> All faculty members are experts in their respective fields and, importantly, experienced board exam lecturers.  They know that "exam world" differs from "real world," and they're single-minded in teaching you the core knowledge required to pass your exam.</p>

        <div id="col2">
       	  <h2>Part 2: Detailed Written Syllabus</h2>
			<p><strong>Convenient Lecture Outlines:</strong> The detailed printed syllabus includes all the course lecture content, clearly formatted to help you follow along. This allows you to focus on highlighting critical concepts, annotating tips and reminders, and achieving the greatest possible recall of the material come test time.</p>
			<p><strong>Question-Based Learning: </strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures and syllabus use a learning approach called "Question-Based Learning." Lectures are constructed out of a series of board-style, multiple-choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question's topic. The syllabus clearly relates the lecture content to the questions you'll see on your exam.</p>
			<p><strong>Pharma-free:</strong> The Pass Machine courses consist of 100% editorially-independent, unbiased lecture material, specifically designed to help you pass your exam. No pharmaceutical company money is sought or accepted.</p>

        	<h2>Part 3: Complete Practice Exams </h2>
			<p><strong>Practice Exams: </strong> You receive online access to hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions. Not only do these online practice exams help you identify areas for further review, they train you in taking exams in the ABFM computer-administered exam format.</p>
			<p><strong>Explanations Included:</strong> Since every question contains a detailed, referenced explanation, each practice exam is a valuable learning exercise.</p>
			<p><strong>CME Included:</strong> The course offers 48 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME credits. Ask if your residency, group, or employer will cover the cost of these CME activities.</p>
			<p><strong>Your online Dashboard: </strong> All your recorded lectures, course handouts, practice tests, and CME credits are organized on your own password-restricted personalized online dashboard. This centralized location of all course materials makes your preparation organized and stress-free. And it allows you access from anywhere at any time - 24/7!</p>
