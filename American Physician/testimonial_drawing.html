<h2>HERE IS JUST SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE’VE RECEIVED</h2>
<p>“My experience taking <em>The Pass Machine</em> was phenomenal!  The instructors were great and the materials were exactly what I needed to be thoroughly prepared for my board exam.  I went into the exam feeling confident and was ecstatic once I received my score back.  I recommend <em>The Pass Machine</em> course to all my friends and colleagues.”<br />
<strong>Chad Cannon, MD, Jacksonville, FL</strong></p>
<p>“The <em>Beat The Boards!</em> course was essential to passing the boards. It is very comprehensive, yet condensed. Concepts are broken down into simplified explanations and material is organized nicely. I plan to take the course for my next board certification and have recommended it to several colleagues as well. A+!”<br />
<strong>Lisa Batson, MD, Louisville, KY</strong></p>
<p>“I have personally told all my colleagues in town, the only reason I passed recertification was because of your course.  It was a great overview as well.  It streamlined the review process so I could do it, enjoy top notch lecturers, and fit it into a hectic private practice schedule.”<br />
<strong>Nancy Cho, MD, Vero Beach, FL</strong></p>
<p>A huge THANK YOU to Jack Krasuski and <em>The Pass Machine</em> faculty!  Not only is it effective for passing the boards, but it is vital for being up-to-date in your daily practice.  I have had trouble passing standardized tests in the past and with the help of <em>The Pass Machine</em>, I passed with flying colors.  With their ‘Pass Guarantee,’ it is really a no-brainer.  You NEED to take this course if you want to pass the boards.”<br />
<strong>Brian Park, MD, Royal Oak, MI</strong></p>
<p>“Just writing to let you know that I passed my boards. I think this course is the best I have taken in years. Through this course I learned how to really study for the new board questions. Thanks again.”<br />
<strong>Ricardo Pena, MD, Rockledge, FL</strong></p>
<p>“I took the course after extensive search for a good, well-credited live course. I was impressed by the material, and the live course was all I was hoping for- ‘Family Medicine in a nutshell.’  The online question bank was very useful as well and it helped me pass my boards.   I will definitely use it for my next board exam.   Thank you, American Physician Institute, for helping me pass my board exam.”<br />
<strong>Maria Latif, MD, Bolingbrook, IL</strong></p>
<p>“All speakers are #1 in their topics; the course is very complete and gives extra-super tips to pass the exam. I would recommend all my peers to take <em>The Pass Machine</em> Family Medicine course!”<br />
<strong>Paquita Moya Huff, MD, San Juan, PR</strong></p>
<p>“I have a very busy Plastic Surgery practice but I wanted to renew my General Surgery Board certification.  Being a solo practitioner, I did not have the luxury of attending a review course.  Luckily, I found out about <em>The Pass Machine</em> online course.  I enjoyed the video lectures, did the review examinations, obtained lots of CME and passed the recertification examination with a smile. Thank you.”<br />
<strong>Ajaipal Kang, MD, Erie, PA</strong></p>
<p>“I would not have had a chance of passing this exam without this course!”<br />
<strong>Robert Robinson, MD, Beaumont, TX</strong></p>
<p>“<em>The Pass Machine</em> was an easy, very comprehensive, detailed, amount of information that was extremely pertinent. It was so convenient to be able to pull up the lectures from wherever I was on the iPhone or iPad.  They teach you strategy, test-taking skills, and help you hone into what is important to know for the boards.  This made all the difference for me, and seeing the word PASS for the first time in 4 years of studying for this test was one of the happiest moments of my life.  THANK YOU PASS MACHINE.”<br />
<strong>Sylvia Abdulian, MD, Shaker Heights, OH</strong></p>
<p>“Best teaching course for any examination, ever! Outstanding.”<br />
<strong>Hubert Johnson, MD, Andover, MA</strong></p>
<p>“This program has absolutely exceeded my expectations!  The lectures are ‘spot on’ preparation not just to pass the test, but are a great review of all the important topics that anesthesiologists are responsible for.  These are the lectures you wish you had in residency, but did not. The online format makes it easy to start-stop the presentations as you prefer and is available 24/7 for a year after purchase. The syllabus is well organized and complete. Thanks for a great program!”<br />
<strong>Jeff Seymore, MD, Tega Cay, SC</strong></p>
<p>“This was an excellent, well-balanced and orchestrated course. One of the best I have attended in 30 years!”<br />
<strong>David Munoz, MD, Tacoma, WA</strong></p>
<p>“I would not have passed the exam without this course. The course was convenient and just right for passing the exam. The ability to review the material and practice questions after the course was the key to my passing. I recommend it highly and plan to take other courses in the future for my recertification.”<br />
<strong>N.H. Salman, MD, Jackson, MS</strong></p>
<p>“This course is excellent, as well as superior to any board review courses I’ve taken in the past! This course is driven to help you and guide you for the boards. Would highly recommend anyone to be part of this experience – you will never regret it.”<br />
<strong>Orlando Almanza, MD, Miami, FL</strong></p>
<p>“Yes, I passed with flying colors. I was very pleased not only to pass, but pass significantly! Your course was instrumental in my results. Thank you for such a great course and such a positive experience.“<br />
<strong>Dawn Idom, MD, Calhoun, GA</strong></p>
<p>“<em>The Pass Machine</em> review was very, very helpful to me. Very simplified, exam-oriented and wide coverage material. It was the only material I used for the written review. I entered the exam with confidence, and indeed I breezed through the test questions with much ease! I knew very well I would pass after the exam and I did! Thanks to <em>The Pass Machine</em>”<br />
<strong>Joachin Uche Okafor, MD, Phoenix, AZ</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t know how a board review course could be done more effectively! Excellent quality of speakers.”<br />
<strong>Robert Marshall, MD, Lafayette, LA</strong></p>
<p>“<em>Beat The Boards!</em> is a ‘must-have’ to prepare for the Adult Neurology Boards.  It is not only thorough, but it also clues you in regarding what to focus on.  By reviewing the material over and over again, I walked into the boards with complete confidence.  I walked out feeling as if I did the very best I could to prepare.  My passing grade was confirmation that the course did, indeed, work.  If I had to do it all over again, I would prepare with Dr. Krasuski and friends in a heartbeat!  You can trust these guys-I did and it paid off.”<br />
<strong>Michelle Boudreau, DO, Vernon, CT</strong></p>
<p>“I took the course right after residency, and found it to be superb! The lectures were efficient, filled with HIGH-YIELD material. The test questions were very similar to the actual exam. This course was a lifesaver for me, especially since I am not the greatest test-taker. Taking this course allowed me to pass!“<br />
<strong>Robert Fishman, MD, Aliquippa, PA</strong></p>
<p>“I couldn’t imagine taking the boards without this course!”<br />
<strong>Alan Kevin Cole, MD, Hattiesburg, MS</strong></p>
<p>“I really enjoyed taking the course and don’t know how people can pass without this essential information.”<br />
<strong>Aarti Kapur, MD, Burlington, NC</strong></p>
