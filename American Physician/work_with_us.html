    <h1 class="alpha">JOIN THE HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE WORKED WITH AMERICAN PHYSICIAN INSTITUTE</h1>
         <p>"I have been truly impressed with API as an organization. I have taken CME courses and taught for a wide variety of medical institutions and have found API's materials and their quality to be exemplary. It is clearly in the top 1% of all educational material I have come across in regard to being useful, up-to-date, and user-friendly. I have found API to be highly professional, flexible to the needs of the learner and willing to go the extra step for the individual above and beyond what traditional CME would do."
