                    <h4>Products And Course Upgrades Not Eligible For Triple Trust Guarantee</h4>
                    <p>The “Triple Trust Guarantee” does NOT apply to the following products or upgrades:</p>
                        <ul class="ind">
                            <li>Courses provided free with another Course as part of a promotional offer</li>
                            <li>Course extensions</li>
                            <li>Live Program upgrades</li>
                            <li>Mobile Learning Package upgrades</li>
                            <li>Guarantee Courses</li>
                            <li>Oral Board Prep Courses</li>
                            <li>Combined/Modular Courses
                                <em>(see special terms for these Courses below)</em>
                            </li>
                            <li>Courses purchased as part of a group discount program
                                <em>(see limited terms for these Courses below)</em>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
 
                    <h4>Guarantee Terms & Conditions For Combined/Modular Courses</h4>
                    <p>To qualify for a combined discounted tuition, you must purchase your Courses at the same time. If you register for multiple Courses with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” at a combined discounted rate, you will receive a prorated guarantee payment based on the number of exams you fail. For example, if you purchase two Courses together at a combined discounted rate and fail one exam, <em>American Physician</em> will refund 50% of your combined Course tuition payment plus $250.</p>
                    
                     <p> In addition, you may participate in the Course designed for the exam you failed with your tuition waived each time you take and fail your board exam. If you fail both exams, <em>American Physician</em> will refund 100% of your total combined Course tuition payment plus $500. In addition, you may participate in the Course with your tuition waived for each exam you fail each time you take and fail that board exam.</p> 
            
                    <h4>Group Purchase Guarantee Terms & Conditions</h4>
                    <p>If you purchase a Course through
                        <em>American Physician’s</em> Group Purchase Program, your Course is eligible for the “Group Purchase Guarantee” which states that if you take and fail the exam for which the Course is designed, you are eligible to participate in the Course tuition-free each time you take and fail your board exam. Courses purchased as part of the Group Purchase and/or the Faculty Referral Programs do not include and are not eligible for The Triple Trust Guarantee.</p> 
            
                    <h4>Board Exams For Which Triple Trust Guarantee Does Not Apply</h4>
                    <p>Although our Courses are useful in studying for a variety of board exams, the Triple Trust Guarantee applies only when you fail the board exam for which the Course you purchased was specifically designed. For example, if you purchase the Geriatric Medicine Course but fail the Psychiatry MOC exam, the Guarantee does not apply.</p> 
                     <p>Any exams with an oral presentation component are specifically excluded from the Triple Trust Guarantee. Further, The Triple Trust Guarantee only applies to exams administered by ABMS-recognized board organizations, and therefore does not apply to AOA and non-US board exams.</p>

                    <p>This agreement and these Terms & Conditions are governed by and construed under the internal laws of the State of Illinois.
