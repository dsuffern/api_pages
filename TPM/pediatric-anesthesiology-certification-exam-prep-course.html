<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Imagine the peace of mind you’ll experience once this immense exam is over and you’ve successfully certified. I’m happy to tell you that this significant moment is closer – and easier to achieve – than you might think.</p>

<p>The Pass Machine<sup>®</sup> course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review. And it comes in two versions – Online and Live – to match your personal learning style and your schedule:</p>
<ul class=ind>
<li><strong>Start Studying Now:</strong> The <strong>Online Course</strong> is available immediately, so you can begin your studies today. Because you can access all the latest course lectures and practice exams anytime, anywhere, and on any device, you can turn any spare minute into study time.</li>
<li><strong>Attend an Interactive and Immersive 4-Day Live Course:</strong> If you find it difficult to carve out daily study time, the live course allows you to review all course material in a concentrated timeframe in a classroom setting. Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Whichever course delivery method you choose – online or live – you receive the same proven learning experience and materials used by hundreds of physicians to prepare for and successfully pass their Pediatric Anesthesiology board certification exam. Here’s how it works:</p>

<div class="eight columns">
<h2>High-Yield Content</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures: </strong> Content strictly follows the ABA<sup>®</sup> Pediatric Anesthesiology Certification exam blueprint. You review only what’s expected on your exam and nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.</li>
<li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</li>
<li><strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn 31 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)™ by participating.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Access</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong> <em>The Pass Machine</em> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad®, so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus is included with every live and online course. It includes all the course lecture material, including lecture images, presented in a highly organized format.  This way it’s easy to follow along with the live and recorded lectures, and can also be used independently of the lectures as a high-yield written resource.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics while
driving and exercising.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Board-style Practice Exams</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>TURN WORRY INTO ACTION – REGISTER NOW!</h2>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What If I'm Not Ready To Take My Exam? Can I Extend My Course?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Some doctors invest in a board-preparation  course many years prior to their exam. In these cases, <em>The Pass Machine</em> allows  course registrants to extend the life of their course by one, three, six, or 12  months for a reduced tuition.
