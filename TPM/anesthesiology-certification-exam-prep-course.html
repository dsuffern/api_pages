<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Our Anesthesiology Certification Board Review is completely redesigned into modules that include all keywords covered on the exam. The enhanced course provides a comprehensive and laser-focused review of the exam topics. The course comes in two versions - online and live - to match your personal learning style and your schedule.</p>
<p>
<em>The Pass Machine</em><sup>®</sup> course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review. And it comes in two versions - online and live - to match your personal learning style and your schedule.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:40px">
<strong>Start Studying Now:</strong> The
<strong>Online Course</strong> is available immediately, so you can begin your studies today. Because you can access all the latest course lectures and practice exams anytime, anywhere, and on any device, you can turn any spare minute into study time.</li>
<li style="margin-left:40px">
<strong>Attend an Interactive and Immersive 5-Day Live Course:</strong> If you find it difficult to carve out daily study time, the live course allows you to review all course material in a concentrated timeframe in a classroom setting. Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Whichever course delivery method you choose – online or live – you receive the same proven learning experience and materials used by hundreds of Anesthesiologists to prepare for and successfully pass their Anesthesiology Certification Board Exam. Here's how it works:</p>

<div class="col-lg-4">
<img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/lecturing.jpg" width="238" height="190" alt="Binder" style="border-radius:3px;margin:30px auto 0" />
</div>
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>HIGH-YIELD CONTENT</h2>
<p><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures:</strong> The newly-designed course is comprised of easily-digestible lecture modules. Modules reflect subtopics mapped to the ABA<sup>®</sup> Anesthesiology exam blueprint, are presented systematically, and organized into lectures covering all related exam keywords. Thus, you effectively review every required topic (i.e., keyword) expected on your exam and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning." Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question's topic.</p>
<p><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</p>
<p>
<strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn up to 43 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)<sup>TM</sup> by participating.</p>

<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>ANYTIME, ANYWHERE ACCESS</h2>
<p><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong>
<em>The Pass Machine</em><sup>®</sup> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad<sup>®</sup> so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus includes all the course lecture material, including images, which is formatted specifically to help you follow along the lectures or to use independently.</p>
<p><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics while
driving and exercising.</p>

<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>BOARD-STYLE PRACTICE EXAMS</h2>
<p>
<strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</p>
<p>
<strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</p>

<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ What If I'm Not Ready To Take My Exam? Can I Extend My Course?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Some doctors invest in a board-preparation course many years prior to their exam. In these cases, course registrants can extend the life of their course for 12 additional months at a reduced tuition rate. If you wish to extend your course, please call 1-877-225-8384 prior to your course expiration date.</div>
<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ What Are The Benefits Of The Live Course?</strong>

<div class="accordionContent">If you find it difficult to carve out daily study time, the live course allows you to review all course material in a concentrated timeframe in a classroom setting. Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</div>

<p class="faq-category-header">
<h2>General Questions About The Triple Trust Guarantee</h2>
</p>
<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ This Guarantee Sounds Too Good To Be True—Is It For Real?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes, it’s completely real. Rest assured, API has always honored its guarantees and always will. When you register for the course, you receive a registration packet with your course information that includes a copy of the Triple Trust Guarantee, along with straightforward information on all of the <a href="triple-trust-terms.html">Terms & Conditions</a> that apply. Why does API have such a guarantee when no other company does?  The Triple Trust Guarantee is API’s way of demonstrating that it’s just as invested in your success as you are. After all, if you fail your board exam, API will pay a penalty. API will refund your course tuition in full, provide you with a bonus, and allow you continued access to the course tuition-free until you pass your exam for as long as the exam is offered by the certifying board. The guarantee ensures API doesn’t get paid for effort, only for results.</div>
<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ What Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you purchase a course with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” and do not pass your board exam, API will refund 100% of your course tuition and pay you an additional $500. Additionally, if you purchase the online course, your access to the online course will be extended an additional year, and then extended for one year each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. If you purchase the live course, you may attend one upcoming live course each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. </div>
<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover Non-Tuition Course Options and Upgrades?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. Course options and upgrades are non-tuition related. Therefore, these fees are not included in any guarantee-related refund payment made under the terms of the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>
<div class="accordionButton">
<strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover The Mobile Learning Package?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. The Mobile Learning Package is a $500 stipend in the form of a Best Buy<sup>®</sup> Gift Card. The Gift Card is to be used to purchase the iPad or other mobile device of your choice. The Mobile Learning Package is non-refundable and is not covered by the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>

<strong>+ Is It Likely That My Employer Will Cover My Tuition?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">You may be surprised at how many residency and fellowship training programs, group practices, and other employers pay for or reimburse you for Category 1 educational activities. After all, it's in everyone's best interests to have you board certified. It really pays to ask your training director, medical director or administrator if you are eligible because some training programs and employers do pay for board exam training.

<em>American Physician Institute</em>is a certified business in the CCR database and can accept government checks and credit cards.</div>
