<!--<h1>The Pass Machine – The Power Behind this Learning System</h1>-->
<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>The Internal Medicine exam covers the totality of internal medicine. Below are the main 11 topic areas:</p>
<p style="width:80%;margin:auto">Cardiovascular Disease, Gastroenterology, Pulmonology, Endocrinology, Rheumatology, Infectious Disease,  Medical Oncology, Hematology, Nephrology/ Urology, Neurology, Dermatology, and General Medicine (which covers an additional 6 topics).</p> 
<p>Given the breadth and depth of up-to-date knowledge that you are expected to have to pass this exam, you need a high-yield, extremely efficient approach for your preparation.</p> 
<p>The Pass Machine<sup>®</sup> Internal Medicine Board Review course was completely redesigned for 2014 to accelerate your learning. We call this new accelerated course the IMX. Based on best-practices and recent advancements in instructional design, we’re able to deliver the same amount of high-yield exam material in a shorter period of time by delivering the course in our learner-friendly, modularized format. This format is especially effective at helping doctors address their unique knowledge gaps by enabling them to easily pinpoint and review modules (i.e., topics) of weakness.  How does it work?  Here’s how:</p>

</div>
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>High-Yield Content</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures: </strong> The newly-designed course is comprised of 258 short, easily-digestible lecture modules presented over 3 days. Modules reflect subtopics mapped to the ABIM Exam blueprint, are presented systematically, and organized into lectures covering all related exam “keywords.” Thus, you effectively review every required topic (i.e., keyword) expected on your exam and nothing else, resulting in less time required to master the material.</li>
<li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the course uses a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Each module is based on a board-relevant multiple choice question that is coupled to a focused presentation on that question’s topic.</li>
<li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</li>
<li><strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn 27 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credits<sup>™</sup> by participating. Your annual employer-provided educational funds may be used to cover the cost of this CME activity. </li>
</ul>

<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Access</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong> <em>The Pass Machine</em> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad®, so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</li>
<li><strong>Repeat Viewing:</strong> Given the accelerated nature of the course, you may choose to view some or all of the recorded lectures more than once. The course permits unlimited access of all course materials in any order you wish for 18 months from purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics at your convenience while driving and exercising using your wireless device.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The course syllabus includes all the lecture material, including images, mailed to you as soon as you register. Follow along with the recorded lectures, or review independently during off-line times!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Board-style Practice Exams</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</li>
</ul>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What If I'm Not Ready To Take My Exam? Can I Extend My Course?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Some doctors invest in a board-preparation  course many years prior to their exam. In these cases, <em>The Pass Machine</em> allows  course registrants to extend the life of their course by one, three, six, or 12  months for a reduced tuition.
