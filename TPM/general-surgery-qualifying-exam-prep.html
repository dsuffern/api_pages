<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>When you take the General Surgery Qualifying Exam this December, it doesn’t matter what your specialty is or what you see in day-to-day practice. You are tested on the entirety of General Surgery – you have to know it all! Imagine the peace of mind you’ll experience once this immense exam is over and you’ve successfully recertified. I’m happy to tell you that this significant moment is closer – and easier to achieve – than you might think.</p>
<p>
<em>The Pass Machine</em><sup>®</sup> course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review. And it comes in two versions - Online and Live - to match your personal learning style and your schedule.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:40px">
<strong>Start Studying Now:</strong> The <strong>Online Course</strong> is available immediately, so you can begin your studies today. Because you can access all the latest course lectures and practice exams anytime, anywhere, and on any device, you can turn any spare minute into study time.</li>
<li style="margin-left:40px">
<strong>Attend an Interactive and Immersive 4-Day Live Course:</strong> If you find it difficult to carve out daily study time, the live course allows you to review all course material in a concentrated timeframe in a classroom setting. Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</li>
</ul><br>
<p>Whichever course delivery method you choose – online or live – you receive the same proven learning experience and materials used by hundreds of surgeons to prepare for and successfully pass their General Surgery Qualifying exam. Here’s how it works:</p>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-lg-4">
<img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/lecturing.jpg" width="238" height="190" alt="Binder" style="border-radius:3px;margin:30px auto 0" />
</div>
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>HIGH-YIELD CONTENT</h2>
<p>
<strong>Laser-Focused Lectures:</strong> Content strictly follows the ABS<sup>®</sup> General Surgery Qualifying exam blueprint. You review only what's expected on your exam and nothing else.</p>
<p>
<strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning." Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question's topic.</p>
<p>
<strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</p>
<p>
<strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn up to 48 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)<sup>TM</sup> by participating.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-lg-4"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/ipad-an1.png" width="248" height="190" alt="iPhone App" /></div>
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>ANYTIME, ANYWHERE ACCESS</h2>
<p><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong>
<em>The Pass Machine</em><sup>®</sup> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad<sup>®</sup> so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</p>
<p><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus includes all the course lecture material, including images, which is formatted specifically to help you follow along the lectures or to use independently.</p>
<p><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics while
driving and exercising.</p>
</div>

<div class="col-lg-4"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/monitor-lecture.jpg" width="248" height="275" alt="Browser Window" /></div>
<div class="col-lg-8">
<h2>BOARD-STYLE PRACTICE EXAMS</h2>
<p>
<strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</p>
<p>
<strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</p>
<p>
<strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</p>

<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>General Questions About The Triple Trust Guarantee</h2></p>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ This Guarantee Sounds Too Good To Be True—Is It For Real?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes, it’s completely real. Rest assured, API has always honored its guarantees and always will. When you register for the course, you receive a registration packet with your course information that includes a copy of the Triple Trust Guarantee, along with straightforward information on all of the <a href="triple-trust-terms.html">Terms & Conditions</a> that apply. Why does API have such a guarantee when no other company does?  The Triple Trust Guarantee is API’s way of demonstrating that it’s just as invested in your success as you are. After all, if you fail your board exam, API will pay a penalty. API will refund your course tuition in full, provide you with a bonus, and allow you continued access to the course tuition-free until you pass your exam for as long as the exam is offered by the certifying board. The guarantee ensures API doesn’t get paid for effort, only for results.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you purchase a course with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” and do not pass your board exam, API will refund 100% of your course tuition and pay you an additional $500. Additionally, if you purchase the online course, your access to the online course will be extended an additional year, and then extended for one year each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. If you purchase the live course, you may attend one upcoming live course each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. </div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover Non-Tuition Course Options and Upgrades?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. Course options and upgrades are non-tuition related. Therefore, these fees are not included in any guarantee-related refund payment made under the terms of the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover The Mobile Learning Package?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. The Mobile Learning Package is a $500 stipend in the form of a Best Buy<sup>®</sup> Gift Card. The Gift Card is to be used to purchase the iPad or other mobile device of your choice. The Mobile Learning Package is non-refundable and is not covered by the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>
