<br>
<h2 style="margin-left:37px">WANT PEACE OF MIND? PASS YOUR EXAM THE FIRST TIME<br> – GUARANTEED!</h2>
</div>
<div id="divider" class="shadow"></div>
<!--  Sales Box *********************  --> 
<div id="block" class="parts">
<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Imagine the peace of mind you’ll experience once this immense exam is over and you’ve successfully certified. I’m happy to tell you that this significant moment is closer – and easier to achieve – than you might think. <em>The Pass Machine</em> course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review course. Hundreds of physicians have used The Pass Machine to prepare for and successfully pass their Gastroenterology Certification Board Exam. Here’s how it works:</p> 

<!-- Start of Left column ******************* -->

<div class="photoleft">
<img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/lecturing.jpg" width="238" height="190" alt="Binder" style="border-radius:3px;margin:30px auto 0" />
</div>
<h2>High-Yield Content</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures: </strong> Content strictly follows the board exam blueprint. You review only what’s expected on your exam and nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.</li>
<li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</li>
<li><strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn 34.5 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)™ by participating.</li>
</ul>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="photoleft"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/ipad-an1.png" width="248" height="190" alt="iPhone App" /></div>
<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Access</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong> <em>The Pass Machine</em> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad®, so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus is included with every live and online course. It includes all the course lecture material, including lecture images, presented in a highly organized format.  This way it’s easy to follow along with the live and recorded lectures, and can also be used independently of the lectures as a high-yield written resource.</li>
</ul>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="photoleft"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/monitor-lecture.jpg" width="248" height="275" alt="Browser Window" /></div>

<h2>Board-style Practice Exams</h2>
<ul class="ind">
<li><strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ When Do I Receive Online Access To Review Course Materials?</strong>

<div class="accordionContent">You receive password-protected access to your API online dashboard within one day of registration, excluding federal holidays.

<div class="accordionContent">If you purchase the online course, the syllabus is shipped to you via UPS the next business day after your order is received by API.

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What If I'm Not Ready To Take My Exam? Can I Extend My Course?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Some doctors invest in a board-preparation course many years prior to their exam. In these cases, course registrants can extend the life of their course for 12 additional months at a reduced tuition rate. If you wish to extend your course, please call 1-877-225-8384 prior to your course expiration date.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Are The Benefits Of The Live Course?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">If you find it difficult to carve out daily study time, the live course allows you to review all course material in a concentrated timeframe in a classroom setting. Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</div>

</div>
<div class="accordionContent">The live course includes live lectures, instant Q&A with faculty, printed syllabus, hundreds of online practice questions, recorded online lecture access starting first day of course, and CME credits upon completion of course.</div>
<div class="accordionButton">

<div class="accordionContent">The Mobile Learning Package is a $500 stipend in the form of a Best Buy® Gift Card. The Gift Card is to be used to purchase the iPad or other mobile device of your choice.

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ How Do I Get My CME Credits?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">After you have viewed all of the course  lectures, you can claim your CME credit by completing the course’s online CME  Evaluation.

<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>General Questions About The Triple Trust Guarantee</h2></p>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ This Guarantee Sounds Too Good To Be True—Is It For Real?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes, it’s completely real. Rest assured, API has always honored its guarantees and always will. When you register for the course, you receive a registration packet with your course information that includes a copy of the Triple Trust Guarantee, along with straightforward information on all of the <a href="triple-trust-terms.html">Terms & Conditions</a> that apply. Why does API have such a guarantee when no other company does?  The Triple Trust Guarantee is API’s way of demonstrating that it’s just as invested in your success as you are. After all, if you fail your board exam, API will pay a penalty. API will refund your course tuition in full, provide you with a bonus, and allow you continued access to the course tuition-free until you pass your exam for as long as the exam is offered by the certifying board. The guarantee ensures API doesn’t get paid for effort, only for results.</div>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you purchase a course with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” and do not pass your board exam, API will refund 100% of your course tuition and pay you an additional $500. Additionally, if you purchase the online course, your access to the online course will be extended an additional year, and then extended for one year each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. If you purchase the live course, you may attend one upcoming live course each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. </div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover Non-Tuition Course Options and Upgrades?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. Course options and upgrades are non-tuition related. Therefore, these fees are not included in any guarantee-related refund payment made under the terms of the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover The Mobile Learning Package?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. The Mobile Learning Package is a $500 stipend in the form of a Best Buy<sup>®</sup> Gift Card. The Gift Card is to be used to purchase the iPad or other mobile device of your choice. The Mobile Learning Package is non-refundable and is not covered by the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>
