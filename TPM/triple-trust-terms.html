<h3>Triple trust guarantee terms & conditions</h3>
<p>When you purchase a course with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” and do not pass your board exam, <em>American Physician Institute</em> will refund 100% of your course tuition and pay you an additional $500. Additionally, if you purchase the online course, your access to the online course will be extended an additional year and then extended for one year each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. If you purchase the live course, you may attend one upcoming live course each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. Mobile Learning Package and other upgrades are non-tuition optional upgrades and, as such, these fees are not included in any guarantee-related refund payment made under the terms of the Triple Trust Guarantee.</p><br />
<h4>Triple Trust Guarantee Payments</h4>
<p>Triple Trust Guarantee payments (100% course tuition refund plus an additional $500) are made via check to the party who has tendered the course payment (such as the applicable check payer, credit card holder and the like). <em>American Physician Institute</em> disclaims liability to any party for payments and credits made in accordance with this policy.</p><br />
<h4>Activating Your Triple Trust Guarantee</h4>
<p>To activate your guarantee you must notify <em>American Physician Institute</em> in writing of your failure to pass <strong>within 45 days of the date of your exam notice,</strong> accompanied by the <strong>original</strong> exam notification.</p>
<p>Send your letter and the <strong>ORIGINAL</strong> copy of your exam notification to: <em>American Physician</em> Institute, 125 Windsor Dr. Suite 111, Oak Brook, IL 60523. (If your accrediting board does not send physical failure notices, you may forward your original notification email to <a href="mailto:info@americanphysician.com">info@americanphysician.com</a>.) Your original exam notification will be returned to you by U.S. mail with your Course guarantee refund check.</p>
<p>Each time you activate your guarantee you must notify <em>American Physician</em> in writing. <strong>Failure to adhere to these guarantee terms and conditions will result in your guarantee being null and void.</strong></p><br />
<h4>Products And Course Upgrades Not Eligible For Triple Trust Guarantee</h4>
<p>The “Triple Trust Guarantee” does NOT apply to the following products or upgrades:
<ul class="ind">
<li>Discounted or Free Courses added to another course as part of a promotional offer</li>
<li>Course upgrades, including live attendance or previous online course version added to a course order</li>
<li>Course extensions or refresher</li>
<li>Mobile Learning Package upgrades </li>
<li>Guarantee Courses</li>
<li>Oral Board Prep Courses</li>
<li>Combined/Modular Courses (<em>see special terms for these courses below</em>)</li>
<li>Courses purchased as part of a group discount program (<em>see limited terms for these courses below</em>)</li>

</ul>
</p><br />
<h4>Guarantee Terms & Conditions For Combined/Modular Courses</h4>
<p>To qualify for a combined discounted tuition, you must purchase your courses at the same time. If you register for multiple courses with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” at a combined discounted rate, you will receive a prorated guarantee payment based on the number of exams you fail. For example, if you purchase two courses together at a combined discounted rate and fail one exam, <em>American Physician Institute</em> will refund 50% of your combined course tuition payment plus $250. In addition, you may participate in the course designed for the exam you failed with your tuition waived each time you take and fail your board exam. If you fail both exams, <em>American Physician Institute</em> will refund 100% of your total combined course tuition payment plus $500. In addition, you may participate in the course with your tuition waived for each exam you fail each time you take and fail that board exam.</p><br />
<h4>Group Purchase Guarantee Terms & Conditions </h4>
<p>If you purchase a course through American Physician Institute’s Group Purchase Program, your course is eligible for the “Group Purchase Guarantee” which states that if you take and fail the exam for which the course is designed, you are eligible to participate in the course tuition-free each time you take and fail your board exam. Courses purchased as part of the Group Purchase and/or the Faculty Referral Programs do not include and are not eligible for The Triple Trust Guarantee.</p><br />
<h4>Board Exams For Which Triple Trust Guarantee Does Not Apply</h4>
<p>Although <em>American Physician Institute</em> courses are useful in studying for a variety of board exams, the Triple Trust Guarantee applies only when you fail the board exam for which the course that you purchased was specifically designed. For example, if you purchase the Geriatric Medicine Course, but fail the Psychiatry MOC exam, the Guarantee does not apply. Any exams with an oral presentation component are specifically excluded from the Triple Trust Guarantee. Further, The Triple Trust Guarantee only applies to exams administered by ABMS-recognized board organizations, and therefore does not apply to AOA and non-US board exams.</p>
