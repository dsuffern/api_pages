<p class="pagetitle">This Course is a Virtual Pass  
Machine!<br />Here's Why:</p><br /> 
<img src="../images/HYL.png" class="foto_right_nb" alt="High Yield Course" />
<strong>LASER FOCUS: </strong>Nationally recognized faculty lead you through 35 hours of lectures that focus specifically and unapologetically on helping you pass the General Surgery Recertification Exam and on nothing else, hence the course name – “The Pass Machine!” Practice questions are embedded into each lecture to get and keep you in exam-mode. And all lecture material is fresh, being videotaped in September 2010. Everything you need – nothing you don’t!<br /><br /> 
<strong>ONLINE PRACTICE TESTS: </strong>Included with your course package is access to <b>hundreds of online multiple choice general surgery recertification board-style questions.</b> Not only do these practice exams help you identify areas for further review, but you also gain competency in taking exams in the computer-administered format. <br /><br /> 
<img src="../images/clip_image0022.jpg" class="foto_right_nb" alt"Jack Krasuski, MD - Executive Director of The American Physician Institute"  /> 

<strong>CME INCLUDED: </strong>Earn up to 35 AMA / PRA Category 1 CME hours by attending. Ask if your group / employer will cover the costs of this CME activity.<br /><br /> 
<strong>TWO WAYS TO VIEW LECTURES: </strong>We provide you with unparalleled flexibility in viewing the lectures, so that you can make every spare minute count. <br /> 
<ul class="sales_list"> 
<li class="sales_list"><strong>1. ONLINE ACCESS: </strong>View all lectures as streaming video on the web from your computer as often as you like. Because you view the speaker and lecture slides side-by-side, it’s just like being at the live course.</li> 
<li class="sales_list"><strong>2. MOBILE ACCESS: </strong>Convert any spare moment into exam prep. View all the lectures on your iPhone<sup>&reg;</sup>, iPod Touch<sup>&reg;</sup> and iPad<sup>&reg;</sup>* or Android&#8482; device  - a brand new & unique feature!</li> 
 
</ul> 
</p><br /> 
 
<!--<div class="homebx">
    <strong>HOME STUDY VERSION:</strong> If you can't make it to the live course, we have a Home Study version. It includes online and mobile access to every one of this year's course lectures that you can view as many times as you like up to the time of your exam. Also included is online access to the hundreds of multiple choice practice questions. To make your study easy, we ship to you the course binder so you can follow along the course lectures. And, of course, the Home Study Course comes with the same Triple Trust Guarantee!</div><br />-->

		<a href="#faq1" class="heading">Is It Likely that My Employer Will Cover My Tuition?</a> 
		<ul id="recent"> 
			<p>You may be surprised at how many residency and fellowship training programs, group practices, and other employers pay for or reimburse you for Category 1 educational activities. So it is really worth asking your training director, medical director or administrator if you are eligible. Some training programs and employers will also pay for board exam training. Remember that it is in everyone’s interest to have you achieve board certification status. And, if you work for the Federal Government, we are a certified business in the CCR database and can accept government checks and credit cards.</p> 
		</ul> 
	</li> 
	<li> 
		<a href="#faq2" class="heading">What Differentiates You from Other Courses?</a> 
		<ul id="popular"> 
			<p>There are three main differences. 1) Our course isn’t just a general review – it’s tailored specifically to the topics and approaches you need to know to pass your exam. 2) Our course is a full preparation system – you get hundreds of MCQs, live course attendance, online lecture review, mobile lecture review, and a hard copy of the course notes. 3) We show our confidence in our courses and our dedication to your success with our Triple-Trust Guarantee – if you don’t pass your exam, you get your money back, plus $500, plus you get to retake the course for free until you do pass.</p>

		<a href="#faq3" class="heading">Who Is Sponsoring This Course?</a> 
		<ul id="categories"> 
			<p>The course is being produced by the American Physician Institute. We have produced hundreds of courses and we train thousands of physicians each year to pass their boards and to remain up to date in their field.  Company-wide, every single one of our educational courses comes with a great guarantee, has full editorial independence, and is free of pharmaceutical and industry sponsorship. </p>

		<a href="#faq5" class="heading">Do I Receive Online Access To Course Material?</a> 
		<ul id="archive"> 
			<p>Yes. When you register for either the live or home study course you receive password-restricted access to your individual online dashboard that consolidates all your online course resources: streaming webinars of every course lecture, the multiple choice question quizzes, and any additional course handouts. </p><br /> 
            <p>To make your review more convenient, you receive two types of access to course lectures: 1) streaming webinars on the computer, and 2) as streaming video specially formatted for your mobile device (available on the iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and on Android devices).</p>

			<p>If you are ordering materials for a course that has already occurred, you will receive online access within one business day, and your written materials will ship via UPS at that same time. For upcoming courses, you will receive access by the start of the live course, since it will be the lectures from that course that will be videotaped for online access. This ensures that the lecture material is as fresh as possible. If you would like to start studying sooner, you can order the previous year’s home study, available immediately, for a small additional investment.</p>

Mail us your form to our office address, fax it to 630-684-0802, or email it to info@americanphysician.com.

			<p>Yes, of course, it is. But because it is so outrageous, we don’t blame you for being a little sceptical. </p><br /> 
            <p>When you register for the course you receive a registration packet with your course information that includes the description of the Triple Trust Guarantee. So you have the guarantee spelled out black on white. And, of course, we’ve always honored our guarantees and always will.</p><br /> 
            <p>Why do we have such a guarantee when no other company does?  We could probably have a successful business without offering such a guarantee, but we don’t want to. We believe that with us you invest in exam success. If you don’t achieve success, then neither do we. In fact, we pay a penalty since if you don’t pass, we pay you more than you paid us, plus give you a repeat of the course until you pass. This guarantee keeps us honest – we don’t get paid for effort, only for results.</p>

		<a href="#faq19" class="heading">What Is the Ambassador Club?</a> 
		<ul id="archive"> 
			<p>When you register for any American Physician Institute course you automatically become a member of the Ambassador Club. As a member, whenever you refer a colleague, they receive a $52 course discount and you receive a $52 check. Why? Because by spreading the good word about our courses to your colleagues, you save us advertising dollars. We spend on average $104 in advertising costs for each doctor who attends one of our courses. We thought it only fair to share that savings with you. So we split the $104 and give the referrer and the referred each $52. You can refer as many colleagues without limit for this discount / reimbursement. </p><br /> 
            <p>How does it work? Easy. When registering (by phone) your colleague simply has to provide your name as the referring doctor and they get their discount and you get your check mailed to you. </p><br />

<p>You’re busy in your private practice and you don’t have much time to take off, and it just forces you to get the basics and go over all the subjects that you don’t use on a daily basis. The speakers are excellent.<br /><a href="../GS3_Testimonials/GS3_10_Arison.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a><br /><strong>-Ron Arison, MD,<br />Pompano Beach, FL</strong></p><br />                          
 <p>What I like is that it’s specifically geared towards the board questions, and that part of it has been  very helpful for me. It’s going to be a big part of my preparation.  <br /><a href="../GS3_Testimonials/GS3_10_Certo.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a><br /><strong>-Louis Certo, MD,<br />Girard, OH</strong></p><br /> 
<p>The course is very important because it helps me to focus and points out what is important and what is less important to pass the exam.<br /><a href="../GS3_Testimonials/GS3_10_Holtkamp.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a><br /><strong>-Diedrich Holtkamp, MD,<br />Brooklyn, NY</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I really like the speakers. I think the information varies by subject matter as to my familiarity – some areas I am familiar with and already know but some I really don’t, and it’s been a long time since I’ve looked at those things.<br /><a href="../GS3_Testimonials/GS3_10_Slama.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a><br /><strong>-David Slama, MD,<br />Rapid City, SD</strong></p><br /> 
<p>The lecture series is great – it seems very well organized. It appears to be a very comprehensive overview focusing on the areas that are most likely to appear on the exam.<br /><a href="../GS3_Testimonials/GS3_10_Vanderlinden.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a><br /><strong>-Joseph Vanderlinden, MD,<br />San Bernardino, CA</strong></p><br />

<p>I feel this course has given me an excellent overview of everything, and I would recommend this course, just as a review course, even if we are not taking the test.  The course style is fine, in 3 and a half days, everything is covered and the speakers were very well chosen.  They did an excellent job. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_1.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>I think the speakers are excellent.  They're well organized, they're articulate and in the main they're succinct.  They direct their comments and their material in an organized presentation of both the points to be made about the examination, as well as the points to be made about surgical and medical standard.  And arguably, that's even more important than test preparation.<br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_2.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>The best thing for me is that it gave me the opportunity to see what's important.  I still have to review everything when I get back, but it highlighted the important aspects I need to study.  <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_3.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>It really gave me the confidence as we were going through and listening to them, that somehow I felt that I was really going to be able to pass the exam without any problem. - <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_4.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>It focused on the importance of the topics that will be questioned.  It also helped to focus on what is considered the standard of care, what the Board answer would be.<br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_5.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>I'm impressed...there's a significant amount of preparation toward the kind of questions you usually get on the Boards. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_6.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>This is an excellent course.  It is actually the void-filling course.  There was a void for the recertification and for certification.  There were many courses out there...this one is the most complete one I've ever seen. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_7.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>The speakers on the whole are excellent, and some are truly outstanding...who've obviously spent a lot of time preparing to give the lectures, who've organized the material well, who are very interested in conveying their knowledge, who are committed to teaching.  So, I'm impressed with the high standards of the speakers. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_8.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>It was recommended to me by a fellow colleague, and so it has lived up to expectations.  Very much comprehensive and informative. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_9.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p> took this course before my third recertification and it's exceeded my expectations.  The staff was incredibly helpful in terms of organizing my stay here at the course. <br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_10.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
<p>It's great course.  It covered just about every topic I think that would be on the exam.  I was well done<br /><a href="http://www.americanphysician.mobi/Testimonials/GS3 Testimonials/GS3_09_MD_11.mov" class="floatbox" rev="width:640 height:480">SEE VIDEO</a></p><br /> 
 
 
 
<p>This course provided me with a comprehensive, practical and interesting review of general surgery which has been very useful in preparing for my recertification exam.<br />- <strong>Marvin Nevonen, MD,<br />Duluth, MN</strong></p><br /> 
<p>It is very difficult for me to leave town, so I did the home version of the course. It worked out extremely well for me because it allowed me to view the webinars at times that my schedule permitted and to view them repeatedly. The proof that the content was what I needed is that I passed my exam.<br />- <strong>Paul Ghaemmaghami, MD,<br />Glen Allen, VA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I passed only because of this course.<br />- <strong>James Morrison, MD,<br />Columbia, SC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>This is the finest review course I have taken. I haven’t taken my third time recertification exam yet, but I am very confident in the outcome. I am also very pleasantly surprised at the practical and useful information presented. I highly recommend this course to my colleagues.<br />- <strong>Haywood Gilliam, MD,<br />Middleton, WI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>This course has provided me with the confidence necessary to take the GS recertification exam. All major topics were covered with the right amount of emphasis in areas likely to show up in the actual test. The review of strategies to take the exam was great.<br />- <strong>Alberto de Hoyos, MD, <br />Chicago, IL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I was very impressed by the quality of your presentations. Many were very well respected in the field of General Surgery.<br />- <strong>James Sihrier, MD, <br />Moline, IL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I find the course material presented is very useful for exam and for practice.<br />- <strong>Satyavardhana Yerubandi, MD,<br /> Huntsville, AL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Great, informative, knowledgeable speakers. Concise information focused on exam topics. Greatly recommended.<br />- <strong>Salimi Wirjosemito, MD, <br />Westmont, NJ</strong></p><br /> 
<p>A great review and tool to help with further study.<br />- <strong>Daniel Maher, MD,<br />Golden, CO</strong></p><br /> 
<p>This is not a “Tricks for test-taking” course. It is a solid review.<br />- <strong>David Slama, MD,<br /> Rapid City, SD</strong></p><br /> 
<p>This was overall a well-organized comprehensive course. I like being able to access info until the time of my boards and I like being able to have access to practice review tests.<br />- <strong>Andrea Rescint, MD,<br /> Concord, MA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>An excellent overview of anticipated ABS areas to be examined. Excellent lectures, c omfortable surroundings.<br />- <strong>Michael Johns, MD,<br />Poteau, OK</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Excellent, concise review course, particularly for surgeons who are in specialty fields. I’m a pediatric surgeon who found this course a great review, very up-to-date and concise. Thanks.<br />- <strong>Maryam Gholizadek, MD,<br /> Irvine, CA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Excellent course. High volume of very concise material.<br />- <strong>Kerry Kole, MD,<br /> Rochester, MI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Excellent, thorough review. I teach residents daily and this course was extremely useful not just for the exam, but for daily practice.<br />- <strong>Michael Fiorucci, MD, <br />LaCrosse, WI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>The lectures are concise and hit the potential exam questions and answers well. It is a good review for a surgeon doing general, breast, vascular, trauma or endocrine or administration practice. Current practice and current answers to likely questions come together well here. The web site is a good study tool.<br />- <strong>Guy Jeanblac, MD, <br />Gladstone, MI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Outstanding.<br />- <strong>William Phelps, MD,<br /> Erie, PA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Excellent coverage of all general surgery.<br />- <strong>Timothy O’Holleran, MD,<br /> North Plattes, NE</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Goal: Pass Recert Exam. Solution: Take this course! Why: Densely packed and efficiently packaged to maximize Recert prep results for busy practicing surgeons.<br />- <strong>Joseph Petelin, MD, <br />Paola, KS</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Materials well-organized with comprehensive review.<br />- <strong>Burton Eisenberg, MD, <br />New London, NH</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Very complete. These four days are an entire board review. I feel like I could take my oral board again after taking this course.<br />- <strong>Joseph Vanderlinden, MD, <br />San Bernardino, CA</strong></p><br /> 
 
 
<p>I think it was a great course for the preparation, but also in general as a useful tool in daily practice. Thank you.<br />- <strong>Yiannis Ioannou, MD, <br />Limassul, CY</strong></p><br /></strong> 
<p>Excellent course, tailored to the needs of a surgeon preparing for recertification!<br />- <strong>Frank Smith, MD, <br />Wapato, WA</strong></p><br /></strong> 
<p>Great course. Thank you.<br />- <strong>Edward Bergic, MD, <br />Sidney, MT</strong></p><br /></strong>

I will recommend this course to our colleagues without any reservation.<br />- <strong>Chikara Ohtake, MD, <br />Honolulu, HI</strong></p><br /></strong> 
 
 
 
<p>The lecturer and slides were organized and an efficient review and learning tool. I took the online version and loved it! I could go back and repeat material I was not familiar with.<br />- <strong>James Brown, MD, <br />Lutherville, MD</strong></p><br /></strong> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Last year was crazy - I am a vascular surgeon. I have not done general surgery in over 10 years. I didn't even have to take the gen surg recert exam. Feeling obligated to still recert in gen surg, I took your course in Chicago the last week of September because I was going to be there anyway to give a lecture elsewhere... I finished the course, gave a lecture at a separate meeting in Chicago the last weekend of the course on critical limb ischemia. The very next Wednesday, (Sept 30, 2009) I took the VASCULAR SURGERY RECERT exam and passed it. From the day of my vasc recert exam until I took the gen surg recert in early December, I did not study anything else for the gen surg recert, at all. I did not even open a book. My entire prep for that exam was sitting in the lectures in Chicago, staying awake and letting the info soak in. I did review the practice tests and questions prior, but, after the course, I did nothing else what so ever. I guess that's why they call it the "Pass Machine!" So, I passed two ABS recert exams within three months! So, I thank you very much for the outstanding course! I would be more than happy to formally share my testimony for your company! Please tell Dr. Jack hello! <br />- <strong>Paul Vaughn, MD, <br />Mesa, AZ</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I took the Home Study Course and found it to be very comprehensive. IT prepared me very well for the recertification examination which I passed the first time taken. This course truly is a great tool to prepare one for the recertification exam. <br /> 
- <strong>Steve Duras, MD, <br />University Place, WA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Overall, excellent review course - best taken online. This was an enormous advantage. Well worth the cost.<br />- <strong>Eric Young, MD, <br />Marion, SC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>THANK YOU for your help in the recent recertification general surgery exam. I found your review course very useful and practical. You have an excellent team of teachers. Needless to say, as we get older it is very difficult to sit and read books to prepare for exams. I am glad I took your course - it helped me to pass the exam with ease. I highly recommend your course to anyone who is to take the recertification exam. Please convey my sincere thanks to everyone in your team.<br /><strong>- Shanmugam Lakshmanan, MD, <br />Salem, IL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Without the course, I felt overwhelmed at the sheer amount of material to read and learn. However, the course brought the material to life, and allowed me to focus on the material which was most important.<br />- <strong>Ali Aurangzeb, MD, <br />Meriden, CT </strong></p><br /> 
<p>I feel more confident about recertification after taking this course. <br />- <strong>Pam Howard, MD, <br />Little Rock, AR</strong></p><br /> 
<p>An excellent course. I would not want to face the exam without the information provided in this course.<br />- <strong>Christopher Capel, MD, <br />Casa Grande, AZ</strong></p><br />  
<p>Excellent review and preparatory course. Thank you.<br />- <strong>Farid Said, MD, <br />Norwalk, OH</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Excellent course. Helps guide me and has improved my knowledge. I feel confident as the exam approaches.<br /><strong>-Todd Sachs, MD, <br />Los Angeles, CA </strong></p><br /> 
<p>This is an excellent review course! I'll recommend it to my colleagues.<br /><strong>- Fernando Estrada, MD, <br />Bethlehem, PA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>This is a better use of my time than sitting at a desk reviewing alone. <br /><strong>- George Woodman, MD, <br />Memphis, TN</strong></p> 
<br /> 
<p>Very good overall review that I believe will be instrumental in obtaining a passing score on the recertification exam.<br /><strong>- Stephen McElmurry, MD, <br />Clarksville, AR</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Great course - well organized.<br /><strong>- Craig Wilkerson, MD, <br />SCC, Utah</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Great review - both clinical and basic knowledge for the busy general surgeon<br /><strong>- Kassem Charara, MD, <br />Dearborn, MI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I thought the course was very helpful, especially in the areas that I don't specifically practice (gynecology, head and neck, urology, vascular). The lectures were very well-organized and concise.<br /><strong>- David Redd, MD, <br />Lookout Mountain, TN</strong></p> 
<br /> 
<p>I thought the presentations were very thorough. The review questions were more difficult than those on the exam. The topics were well-covered and the information up-to-date.<br /><strong>- Harry Ballard, MD, <br />New Bern, NC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Great material - especially the multiple choice questions<br /><strong>- Majed Jandali, MD, <br />Kenosha, WI</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Overall, excellent review course - best taken online. This was an enormous advantage. Well worth the cost.<br /> 
<strong>- Eric Young, MD, <br />Marion, SC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Very complete, informative and practical.<br /><strong>- Mario Mancheno, MD, <br />Weehawken, NJ</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I have never been able to stay awake and interested for as long and for as much material as I did for this meeting - excellent!<br /><strong>- Arthur Jones, MD</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Dear Dr. Krasuski: A great forum to prepare for recertification. Sincerely,<br /><strong>- Henry Wodnicki, MD, <br />Miami Beach, FL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Dear Rafael: My score was 80, 62% of examines scored lower than I. Again, thank you for your course.<br /><strong>- George H Pfaltzgraff, MD, <br />Hampton, IA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>A comprehensive review course geared to prepare a physician for the boards in a very short period of time..<br /><strong>- Ela Timbadia, MD, <br />Phoenix, AZ</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Overall a very good course - speakers were knowledgeable and approachable.<br /><strong>- Joseph Pearson, MD, <br />Florence, SC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Very easy to access, and a great way to ensure a solid preparation for General Surgery Board Certification.<br /><strong>- Patrick Gonzalez, MD, <br />Tampa, FL</strong></p><br /> 
<p>The course is an excellent home study option. It offers a concise "need to know" presentation of materials required to pass the recertification exam. It is an efficient and effective use of time<br /><strong>- Elizibeth Suh, MD, <br />Florence, MT</strong></p><br /> 
<p>I have attended several review courses, but this one is by far the best.<br /><strong>- William Noell, MD, <br />Silva, NC</strong></p><br /> 
<p>As an online participant, the course format made me feel as though it was my personal course.<br /><strong>- Anne-Marie Regal, MD, <br />Corte Madera, CA</strong></p><br /> 
<p>Very positive. Very educational<br /><strong>- Adel Armanious, MD, <br />Latrobe, PA</strong></p>
