<h1>The Pass Machine – The Power Behind this Learning System</h1>
<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Imagine the peace of mind you’ll experience once your Family Medicine Board Exam is behind you. Well, I’m happy to tell you that this significant moment is closer – and easier to achieve - than you might think.</p>

<p>Each year, thousands of physicians credit <em>The Pass Machine</em> Course with helping them pass their board exam, and it is <span style="text-decoration:underline">guaranteed</span> to do the same for you. Here’s what makes <em>The Pass Machine</em> Family Medicine Board Review so effective:</p>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div id="col1">
<img src="css/img/iphoneapp.jpg" width="246" height="127" alt="iPhone App" />
<p>"Comprehensive! One of the few review classes that meets our expectations."
<span>Eduardo Austria, MD,Auburn, KS</span></p>
</div>
<div id="col2">
<h2>HIGH-YIELD CONTENT</h2>
<p><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures:</strong> Content strictly follows the ABFM® Family Medicine exam blueprint. You review only what’s expected on your exam and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each
coupled to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.</p>
<p><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</p>

<h2>BOARD-STYLE PRACTICE EXAMS</h2>

<p><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</p>
<p><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> Every MCQ includes a detailed, referenced explanation. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</p>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Do You Provide Reviews For Boards Other Than Family Medicine?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes! In fact, we provide preparation for dozens  of other specialty and subspecialty board exams. Check out <a href="http://www.AmericanPhysician.com" target="_blank">www.AmericanPhysician.com</a> for the full list.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Is It Likely That My Employer Will Cover My Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">You may be surprised at how many residency and  fellowship training programs, group practices, and other employers pay for or  reimburse you for Category 1 educational activities. After all, it’s in  everyone’s best interests to have you board certified. It really pays to ask  your training director, medical director or administrator if you are eligible  because some training programs and employers do pay for board exam training.  And, if you work for the Federal Government, <em>American Physician Institute </em>is  a certified business in the CCR database and can accept government checks and  credit cards.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Can I Get A Discount For The Course Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent"><em>American Physician Institute </em>offers  group discounts for residents and fellows and individual discounts through our  Ambassador Club (see below). Please call 877-225-8384 for more information on  these discounts</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Is The Ambassador Club? How Does It Work?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you register, you automatically become a  member of the <em>American Physician Institute </em>Ambassador Club, which helps  your colleagues benefit from your prep Course experience. If your colleagues  mention your name when they call to register, they’ll each receive a $52  discount on their first Course registration and you’ll receive a $52 check.  <br>
  <br>
  Why $52? <em>API </em>recognizes that your  referral saves about $104 in advertising costs, and they think it’s only fair  to pass those savings along to both of you.
