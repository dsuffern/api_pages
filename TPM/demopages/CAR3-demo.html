<p>If your Cardiovascular Disease Maintenance of Certification Exam takes place in 2014, now there’s absolutely no reason for you to go into the exam without knowing how well you’ll do. If you’ve gotten this far in your medical career with the degree of success you’ve had, you’re probably not the type of person who leaves crucial things to chance.</p>
<p>In the past, you’ve had no choice but to take your Cardio boards blind, so to speak.</p>
<p>I’m happy to inform you that a <span style="color:#009ee0">FREE Practice Test</span> is now available that makes the “hope-for-the-best” and “don’t-really-know-what-to-expect” approach a thing of the past. The new assessment was developed specifically for the Cardiovascular Disease MOC board exam. This 70-question practice test is designed to reflect the exact topic areas in the right proportions of the ABIM<sup>®</sup> exam blueprint. Further, each practice question is designed to reflect the style of the questions on your upcoming board exam.</p> 
<p>Thus, after a few minutes, you’ll have a realistic assessment of how well prepared you are overall, and which specific topic areas need additional review before your exam. Remember, the Cardiovascular Disease MOC exam tests you on all aspects of cardiology, not just the areas of focus in your medical practice.</p>
<p>Now, you may ask, what’s in it for American Physician Institute to offer you such a great service at no cost? The answer is simple. As more Cardiologists learn about <em>The Pass Machine</em> Cardiovascular Disease Board Review, the course will enjoy even greater success. Undoubtedly, many doctors who take advantage of our free assessment will find it very valuable, and will decide to invest in our full board review course. But, I’ll respect your decision and wish you the best on your exam, whether or not you later choose to take <em>The Pass Machine</em> board review course.</p>
<p>That’s a decision for a later day. Right now, please take advantage of this free assessment. I truly believe it will be an invaluable – perhaps even eye-opening – experience for you. A small time investment with a big payoff!</p> 
<p>Without further delay, please submit the form at right to access your free assessment. You’ll be glad you did!</p>
<p>To your exam success,</p>

<h2>High-Yield Content</h2>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures: </strong> Content strictly follows the board exam blueprint. You review only what’s expected on your exam and nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.</li>
<li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</li>
<li><strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn 40.75 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)™ by participating.</li>

<li><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus is included with every live and online course. It includes all the course lecture material, including lecture images, presented in a highly organized format.  This way it’s easy to follow along with the live and recorded lectures, and can also be used independently of the lectures as a high-yield written resource.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics while
driving and exercising.</li>

<h2>Board-style Practice Exams</h2>
<ul class="unstyled">
<li><strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</li>
