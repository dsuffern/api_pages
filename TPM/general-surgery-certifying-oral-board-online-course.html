<p class="faq-category-header">
<h2>General Questions About The General Surgery certifiying Prep Course</h2>
</p>

</ol>
</div>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Who Is Sponsoring This General Surgery Certifying Oral Board Review Course? </strong></div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Where Can I find Information About Taking My ABS Board Exam?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">For information about the ABS General Surgery Certifying Board Exam, please visit<br />
<a href="http://www.absurgery.org/default.jsp?certcehome" target="_blank">http://www.absurgery.org/default.jsp?certcehome</a>. </div>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Do You Provide Reviews for Boards Other Than General Surgery Certifying?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes! In fact, we provide preparation for dozens of other specialty and subspecialty board exams. Check out<br />
  <a href="http://www.americanphysician.com/" target="_blank">www.AmericanPhysician.com</a> for the full list..</div>

<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>Accessing Your Online Materials</h2></p>


<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ How Do I Access My Online Materials?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you register, you receive password-restricted access to an online dashboard that consolidates all your online course resources: streaming webinars of every course lecture, and a thick syllabus with written materials.<br />
  <br />
To make your review more convenient, you can access course lectures in two ways: 1) streaming webinars on your computer; and 2) streaming video on your mobile device with internet access.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ When Do I Get My Home Study Online Access/Materials?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">You will receive online access within one business day, and your written materials will ship via UPS at that same time.</div>



<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ How Long Do I Have Access To My Online Materials?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Online material and course content will be available for a minimum of one year following the administration of the associated exam. For example, 2012 course materials will be available through the 2013 exam. This allows you to start studying well in advance of your scheduled exam, and you have the option of upgrading to next year's live or home study course for a small additional investment. If your exam is more than one year out, call Customer Service at 877-225-8384 to extend your access.<br />
</div>


<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ This Guarantee Sounds Too Good To Be True—Is It For Real?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">If you purchase a course with a 100% Money-Back Guarantee and do not pass your board exam, American Physician Institute will refund 100% of your tuition. To be eligible for the guarantee, you must fully complete all course activities. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. If you wish to activate your guarantee, you must notify American Physician Institute in writing of your failure to pass within 45 days of the date of your exam notification, accompanied by the original exam notification. Send this information to: American Physician Institute, 125 Windsor Dr., Suite 111, Oak Brook, IL 60523.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ How Do I Get My CME Credits?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">After you have viewed all of the course lectures, you can claim your CME credit by completing the course's online CME Evaluation. After you complete the evaluation, you will immediately receive a PDF of your CME certificate. The evaluation is located on your Course Dashboard under the "CME" tab. Simply click the link and then fill in your username and password when prompted..<br />
</div>
<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>General Surgery Certifying Board Review Course Tuition Discounts</h2></p>
</p>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Is It Likely That My Employer Will Cover My Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">You may be surprised at how many residency and fellowship training programs, group practices, and other employers pay for or reimburse you for Category 1 educational activities. After all, it's in everyone's best interests to have you board certified. It really pays to ask your training director, medical director or administrator if you are eligible because some training programs and employers do pay for board exam training. And, if you work for the Federal Government, American Physician Institute (API) is a certified business in the CCR database and can accept government checks and credit cards..</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Can I Get a Discount For The Course Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">API offers group discounts for residents and fellows and individual discounts through our Ambassador Club (see below). Please call 877-225-8384 for more information on these discounts..</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Is The Ambassador Club? How Does It work?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you register, you automatically become a member of the American Physician Institute Ambassador Club, which helps your colleagues benefit from your prep course experience. If your colleagues mention your name when they call to register, they'll each receive a $52 discount on their first course registration and you'll receive a $52 check.<br />
    <br />
        <br />
      Why $52? American Physician Institute recognizes that your referral saves about $104 in advertising costs, and they think it's only fair to pass those savings along to both of you. There's no limit to the goodwill and gratitude you'll inspire among your colleagues, and there's no limit to how many colleagues you can refer. You can make referrals across specialties, too! See the full list of API courses at <a href="http://www.americanphysician.com/" target="_blank">www.AmericanPhysician.com</a> and consider making a referral today.<br />
