<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>“I can honestly say that the only reason I passed the cardiology boards the last time I took them was because of <em>The Pass Machine</em>. <em>The Pass Machine</em> is the best board review course you can take.  Unlike other courses, The Pass Machine is concise and only goes over what you really need to know for the boards.  I previously took the Mayo Board Review course, which spent too much time reviewing things that were not needed for just taking the boards. I felt like this only made it harder to decide what was pertinent and what was not.  The questions <em>The Pass Machine</em> gave to review were great for cardiology board preparation.  I would highly recommend <em>The Pass Machine</em> as the only concise board review for the Cardiology boards. “<br />
<strong>Jeffrey W. Bissing, DO, Shawnee Mission, KS</strong></p>
<p>“I was extremely pleased with the format of this course and the ability to review all lectures online over and over till mastered.  The set of practice questions are designed for you to know exactly what the Boards expect from you.  When you study from this course, your confidence and knowledge to pass is real.  I recommend it highly.”<br />
<strong>Victor Mejia, MD, Bogalusa, LA</strong></p>
<p>“A superb, focused overview of cardiology with emphasis on board-relevant material while maintaining relevance to clinical practice.”<br />
<strong>Paul Kim, MD, Greenwood, SC</strong></p>
<p>“This course is excellent, as well as superior to any board review courses I’ve taken in the past! This course is driven to help you and guide you for the boards. Would highly recommend anyone to be part of this experience – you will never regret it.”<br />
<strong>Orlando Almanza, MD, Miami, FL</strong></p>
<p>“Very useful, informative, in-detail. Extremely helpful for both boards and private practice.”<br />
<strong>Charles Villoch, MD, Coral Gables, FL</strong></p>
