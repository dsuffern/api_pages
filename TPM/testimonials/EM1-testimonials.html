<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>“Great course. No regrets. CME is a bonus. Would recommend without hesitation.”<br />
<strong>Thomas Smith, MD, Evans, GA</strong></p>
<p>“Excellent online course. Much better and more efficient than I would have been able to accomplish on my own.”<br />
<strong>Anna Scott, MD, Morgantown, WV</strong></p>
<p>“I found this course to be well-attuned to the ABEM Recertification Exam. It defragged my brain and set me in a will-pass-the-exam frame of mind! And I did pass! I also received a high passing grade. Thank you Jack et al.”<br />
<strong>Victor Estraba, MD, Woodbury, CT</strong></p>
<p>“This is a great review course in Emergency Medicine.  Speakers are knowledgeable and I learned so much in such a short time (4 day review course).  I am now more confident in taking the Board Exam in Emergency Medicine.”<br />
<strong>Probo Costillo, MD, Richlands, VA</strong></p>
<p>“This is the best summation of all the salient topics in Emergency Medicine on the market – bar none!”<br />
<strong>Keith Waggoner, MD, San Antonio, TX</strong></p>
<p>“Excellent board review course: comprehensive, time-efficient, and more enjoyable than I expected. I would highly recommend it.”<br />
<strong>Mary Dunne, MD, Rhinebeck, NY</strong></p>
<p>“Unsure of which review course I should take, I took a chance on the American Physician Institute. I believe I picked the winning ticket! The course was extremely thorough, most interesting, and even entertaining at times. A solid review, with key tips on what will be tested and a comprehensive syllabus from which to study.”<br />
<strong>Theresa Gabana, MD, Norwich, VT</strong></p>
<p>“Excellent course!  I entirely credit The Pass Machine with my passing the ConCert exam with 83% score. Not bad for a last minute study anchored solely on the combined Pass Machine 2011 and 2012 courses. For me it was as good as the OHIO ACEP and NEMBER courses that I took for my previous re-certifications. Thanks a million Jack and all your team. “<br />
<strong>Netanel Herscovitch, MD, Lincolnwood, IL</strong></p>
<p>“Thank you for all the great work you are doing for us. Last year I attended the course, and it was the best I ever attended for the board preparation. The best part is that I could watch all the lectures repeatedly until i took the test - made it easy. Worth every penny I spent.  Thank you!”<br />
<strong>Chowdary Adusumilli, MD, Chicago, IL</strong></p>
<p> “I have been practicing urgent care medicine for the last 8 years, after 25 years in the ER, and I wanted to recertify. I looked at a few courses and decided on The Pass Machine not only for the content but also the promise to refund my tuition if I didn't pass. I needed as much help as I could get because I don't see complex cases anymore and haven't for a while. I found <em>The Pass Machine</em> to be convenient to my schedule, reviewing lectures when I could and then repeating the more complicated ones. The lectures were concise and the information was up to date, and presented in a more informal and entertaining way. I particularly enjoyed the cardiology lecture, which can be a dry topic but this presenter really kept my attention. Also, the practice questions were very pertinent and helped me decide the topics I needed to give more attention. When it came time to take the exam, I felt I had confidence and reassurance that I could actually pass it, especially after I had been out of the ER for so long. This was probably my last recert exam and I am very thankful that with the help of <em>The Pass Machine</em> I passed.”<br />
<strong>Patricia Cook, MD, Apple Valley, MN</strong></p>
<p>“<em>The Pass Machine</em> review was very, very helpful to me. Very simplified, exam-oriented and wide coverage material. It was the only material I used for the written review. I entered the exam with confidence, and indeed I breezed through the test questions with much ease! I knew very well I would pass after the exam and I did! Thanks to <em>The Pass Machine</em>!”<br />
<strong>Joachin Uche Okafor, MD, Phoenix, AZ</strong></p>
<p>I attended <em>The Pass Machine</em> course in Chicago in August of 2011 and took the Board exam October 4, 2011. Other than reviewing the notes and lectures, I did not do any other preparation for the Board exam. Besides working full time in the ER, I had 6 children under the age of 12 at the time, so as you can imagine, not much review took place! I am convinced that attending the course alone enabled me to pass the test. This was my third recert (and last!), so I have attended other review courses. This was far and away the best.“<br />
<strong>Beth Lux, MD, Green Bay, WI</strong></p>
<p>“My experience was a little different because I hadn't done emergency medicine for several years, so I had to be able to review quickly and thoroughly. I also wasn't able to go to the course. The review book and the on-line material were excellent. I even took the book camping in Boundary Waters, MN. When the ConCert exam came, I passed with an 87%. Thanks for having a great review course!”<br />
<strong>George Nobile, MD, Louisville, KY</strong></p>
