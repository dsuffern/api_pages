                <br>The General Surgery Recertification Course</h1>

            <blockquote>“The American Physician Institute is holding this course in general surgery with speakers of first class in their respective field of expertise. Very focused and up to date in the current surgical needs of our practice in surgery. I recommend this course without hesitation to anyone looking for a deep review - Thank you Dr. Krasuski for your vision.”
                <cite>Luis Serentill, MD, Miami, FL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“An excellent course. I would not want to face the exam without the information provided in this course.”
                <cite>Christopher Capel, MD, Casa Grande, AZ</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“All I did to prepare for my recent exam was listening to the lectures and take the practice tests (no additional reading). Passed in the 93rd percentile. I’ll be back in 10 years. Thanks!”
                <cite>Walter Woodrow Burns III, MD, Chapel Hills</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I found this course comprehensive, focused for recertification and practical. I highly recommend it for practicing general surgeons.”
                <cite>Shanmugam Lakshmanan, MD, Salem, IL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The webinar format for this course was fantastic. It allowed me to watch lectures and review subjects at my own leisure, without the hassle of travel and accommodations. Great job. In addition, the practice exams allow one to review their knowledge base.”
                <cite>Anthony Lowham, MD, Lander, WY</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This year I will be taking my 3rd recertification examination. I had taken 3 recertification review courses before. I believe yours is the best of all I have experienced.”
                <cite>John Chacko, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I called a colleague whose name I saw on your flyer. She recommended the course and helped in my decision to sign-up for the home study course. Although I had already purchased another program, I liked the guarantee and wanted to pass, hope to pass on the 1st attempt on year 10 before expiration. I did not have time in a busy practice to leave town, and I like the ability to go to the lectures, test questions and slides on-line right from my desk at work or home and not have to have the DVD’s with me at all times. Just login and I’m there!”
                <cite>Greggory N. Angier, MD, Mt. Pleasant, TX</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The quality of the course material, its design and the speakers were in one word – Excellent!!! The format of the home study course and webinars combined with practice exams that were easily accessible on any computer with internet access and my mobile phone allowed me, a busy community general surgeon, to make the best use of my time and review some unfamiliar topics more than once. Re-certification exam aside, I am a better, more informed and educated surgeon today because of this course. Thanks!”
                <cite>Kranthi Achanta, MD, Fremont, CA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The course was unbelievably helpful. There just seemed to be so much more information to learn this time around. Your course covered most topics on the test. The home study allowed me to complete the course at my leisure and I have listened to many of the lectures over and over. I now look forward to attending the Master Trauma course. By the way, I passed!”
                <cite>Thomas Vinson, MD, Columbus, MS</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Great review prep course. I am a busy general surgeon with a private practice and cover a busy ER every other night. Am pres med staff with lots of meetings and issues to deal with. Difficult to find quality time to organize my review and study material, but no need you did it all. Easy to access webinars and practice tests. Felt super comfortable walking into the exam and especially after leaving it. Very prepared, a great experience, no stress with this exam after the course.”
                <cite>George Tershakovec, MD, Homestead, FL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This course left me well prepared and confident for the recertification exam. There were no surprises and I felt each question was addressed during the course. The practice exams were outstanding and close variations were encountered. I breezed through the exam with time to spare. When I left the exam I knew I had passed thanks to your course.”
                <cite>Chris Wagner, MD, Appleton, WI</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Took the home study course. Excellent distillation of information. The web-based course allows for excellent use of spare time anywhere, even with the iPhone.”
                <cite>John Yatsu, Austin, TX</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I took the home study course, and it was perfect for me. I reviewed the lectures in the evenings and weekends just a few weeks before my Recert. I had no trouble finishing or passing, thanks to this course!”
                <cite>James Redmann, MD, Covington, LA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“An excellent course with great technological enhancements and many relevant sample questions.”
                <cite>Robert Weiner, MD, Kalaheo, HI</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“If you are considering a single source or course to use to prepare for general surgery recertification,
                <em>The Pass Machine</em>should be at the top of the list. I just successfully completed my third recertification and found that The Pass Machine definitely works. Try it – you’ll like it!”
                <cite>Phillip Lindsay, MD, Alexandria, CA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I took the Home Study Course and found it to be very comprehensive. IT prepared me very well for the recertification examination which I passed the first time taken. This course truly is a great tool to prepare one for the recertification exam.”
                <cite>Steve Duras, MD, University Place, WA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“THANK YOU for your help in the recent recertification general surgery exam. I found your review course very useful and practical. You have an excellent team of teachers. Needless to say, as we get older it is very difficult to sit and read books to prepare for exams. I am glad I took your course – it helped me to pass the exam with ease. I highly recommend your course to anyone who is to take the recertification exam. Please convey my sincere thanks to everyone in your team.”
                <cite>Shanmugam Lakshmanan, MD, Salem, IL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The American Physician review course for General Surgery is the most complete and comprehensive I have attended. The faculty was excellent – they seemed so sincere in wanting to teach us so we can pass the recertification test. For a busy practicing solo surgeon with limited time, it was a pleasure for me having them (the faculty and staff) be so interested in our recertification and testing.”
                <cite>Steven Feldhaus, MD, Omaha, NE</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Excellent course. Dr. Krasuski and his staff have obviously spent a significant amount of time on preparing for this course. The presenters really focused on key topics and pointed out the important principles to take home. I would highly recommend this course to anyone preparing for the recertifying exam.”
                <cite>Anonymous</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Intense but very useful and refreshing course with recent developments in all specialties included. A very good course oriented towards the ABS exam.”
                <cite>K.B. Deshpande, MD, Westlake, OH</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The time away from my practice was well worth it. Concise information, provided efficiently. Definitely lots of information delivered in short order. Much better organized than other board review courses.”
                <cite>Andrew J. Berson, MD, FACS, Colorado Springs, CO</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This high-quality course delivers nicely. Knowledge & experience of faculty establishes credibility. Good communicators who were very focused. Course materials are excellent. Support staff are helpful.”
                <cite>J.M. Hassett, MD, Buffalo, NY</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This is the third time I’ve taken this course, and I have never been disappointed. Outstanding job.”
                <cite>Douglas Smego, MD, Chicago, IL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I believe the faculty has done an outstanding job in trying to cover such a vast amount of material in such a short time. An exceptional review of the subject matter in preparation for the exam.”
                <cite>Thomas Mincheff, MD, Hartsville, SC</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“You’re busy in your private practice and you don’t have much time to take off, and it just forces you to get the basics and go over all the subjects that you don’t use on a daily basis. The speakers are excellent.”
                <cite>Ron Arison, MD, Pompano Beach, FL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“What I like is that it’s specifically geared towards the board questions, and that part of it has been very helpful for me. It’s going to be a big part of my preparation. “
                <cite>Louis Certo, MD, Girard, OH</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I really like the speakers. I think the information varies by subject matter as to my familiarity – some areas I am familiar with and already know but some I really don’t, and it’s been a long time since I’ve looked at those things.”
                <cite>David Slama, MD, Rapid City, SD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“The lecture series is great – it seems very well organized. It appears to be a very comprehensive overview focusing on the areas that are most likely to appear on the exam.”
                <cite>Joseph Vanderlinden, MD, San Bernardino, CA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“It’s all interesting, relevant, and there’s a lot of it.”
                <cite>William Waldo, MD, Show Low, AZ</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Last year was crazy - I am a vascular surgeon. I have not done general surgery in over 10 years. I didn’t even have to take the gen surg recert exam. Feeling obligated to still recert in gen surg, I took your course in Chicago the last week of September because I was going to be there anyway to give a lecture elsewhere… I finished the course, gave a lecture at a separate meeting in Chicago the last weekend of the course on critical limb ischemia. The very next Wednesday, (Sept 30, 2009) I took the VASCULAR SURGERY RECERT exam and passed it. From the day of my vasc recert exam until I took the gen surg recert in early December, I did not study anything else for the gen surg recert, at all. I did not even open a book. My entire prep for that exam was sitting in the lectures in Chicago, staying awake and letting the info soak in. I did review the practice tests and questions prior, but, after the course, I did nothing else what so ever. I guess that’s why they call it the "Pass Machine!" So, I passed two ABS recert exams within three months! So, I thank you very much for the outstanding course! I would be more than happy to formally share my testimony for your company! Please tell Dr. Jack hello!”
                <cite>Paul Vaughn, MD, Mesa, AZ</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>"The lecturer and slides were organized and an efficient review and learning tool. I took the online version and loved it! I could go back and repeat material I was not familiar with."
                <cite>James Brown, MD, Lutherville, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Without the course, I felt overwhelmed at the sheer amount of material to read and learn. However, the course brought the material to life, and allowed me to focus on the material which was most important.”
                <cite>Ali Aurangzeb, MD, Meriden, CT</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I feel more confident about recertification after taking this course.”
                <cite>Pam Howard, MD, Little Rock, AR</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Excellent course. Helps guide me and has improved my knowledge. I feel confident as the exam approaches.”
                <cite>Todd Sachs, MD, Los Angeles, CA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Very good overall review that I believe will be instrumental in obtaining a passing score on the recertification exam.”
                <cite>Stephen McElmurry, MD, Clarksville, AR</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Excellent tool to assure passing the examination.”
                <cite>Slobodon Jazarevic, MD, Fort Pierce, FL</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“A comprehensive review course geared to prepare a physician for the boards in a very short period of time.”
                <cite>Ela Timbadia, MD, Phoenix, AZ</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“It offers a concise “need to know” presentation of materials required to pass the recertification exam. It is an efficient and effective use of time.”
                <cite>Elizibeth Suh, MD, Florence, MT</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I have attended several review courses, but this one is by far the best.”
                <cite>William Noell, MD, Silva, NC</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“As an online participant, the course format made me feel as though it was my personal course.”
                <cite>Anne-Marie Regal, MD, Corte Madera, CA</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I took the course online. That made it very convenient. I could do it at my own speed and it filled hours normally wasted while I am sitting in the surgeon’s lounge waiting for my cases to start.”
                <cite>Howard Berger, MD, Brick, NJ</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This course represents a component of one’s efforts to continue the education process – studying for a test for recertifying is admittedly daunting and intimidating. A course like this gives one the satisfaction that they have covered a large amount of testable/current information and for me represents a source of confidence as I continue in my preparations.”
                <cite>Thomas Boyle, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I have never been able to stay awake and interested for as long and for as much material as I did for this meeting – excellent!”
                <cite>Arthur Jones, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I have practiced trauma and surgical critical care for 20 years. I am taking my third recertification for General Surgery. I needed a review of the other areas of general surgery. This course exceeded my expectations for this review. The staff was helpful in getting me in to the course. I will recommend this course to my colleagues.”
                <cite>Ed Racek, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I have been at another pre-test course – I found this course was more focused and concise. I feel more confident heading into the exam having been here and having the materials from this course to study at home.”
                <cite>Louis Blaum, MD</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I appreciated how each lecture highlighted critical study areas and clarified their learning. I am hopeful for a successful exam.”

            </blockquote>

                <cite>L. Neal McCain, MD, Carbondale, IL</cite>
            </blockquote>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“I find the practice questions both during the lectures and online to be very helpful. They seem most effective when the speaker explains why certain answers are right and why the others are wrong.“
                <cite>Craig Iwamoto, MD, Las Vegan, NV</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“Very helpful and great review of everything when you are out of touch for 9-10 years.”
                <cite>N. Chowdhury, MD, Proctorville, OH</cite>
            </blockquote>

            </blockquote>

                <cite>Robert Rossio, MD, University Heights, OH</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>“This course really captures the essence of all the information needed to recertify in General Surgery. It’s perfect for those of us who are “senior citizens” and/or not doing general surgery. The AV presentation slides and especially the course notebooks were superb. 5 stars!”
