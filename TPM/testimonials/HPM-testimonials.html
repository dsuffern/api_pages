<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>“I had very little exposure to hospice, but this course taught me all that is needed to pass the board! This course, I believe, will be particularly helpful to the vast majority of physicians who cannot grasp all material with a one-time hearing. I checked the website after the first day and as promised, material was uploaded on the website!”<br />
