<h1>Testimonials</h1>
<p>“I just received notification that I passed (with room to spare)! As an electrophysiologist, I needed to review general cardiology and thought your lecturers were on target and on content. I have already recommended your course to others planning to take the boards this fall.”<br />
<strong>Raul Mitrani, MD, FACC, FHRS, Bay Harbor Islands, FL</strong></p>
<p>“<em>The Pass Machine</em> was instrumental in preparing me for board recertification in the subspecialty of cardiology.  I watched all the lectures at home on my iPad and PC.  The boards require mastering of a large volume of material. I don't think that I would have passed the boards successfully without the help of The Pass Machine syllabus. Sample questions were also very helpful.  <em>The Pass Machine</em> stands by their product by offering a refund if you are not successful in passing the boards. Thank you Pass Machine.  I will certainly use you again in 10 years.”<br />
<strong>Bruce J. Kriegel, MD, FACC, Sharon, MA</strong></p>
<p>“I was extremely pleased with the format of this course and the ability to review all lectures online over and over till mastered.  The set of practice questions are designed for you to know exactly what the Boards expect from you.  When you study from this course, your confidence and knowledge to pass is real.  I recommend it highly.”<br />
<strong>Victor Mejia, MD, Bogalusa, LA</strong></p>
<p>“I have personally told all my colleagues in town, the only reason I passed recertification was because of your course.  It was a great overview as well.  It streamlined the review process so I could do it, enjoy top notch lecturers, and fit it into a hectic private practice schedule.”<br />
<strong>Nancy Cho, MD, Vero Beach, FL</strong></p>
<p>“I can honestly say that the only reason I passed the cardiology boards the last time I took them was because of <em>The Pass Machine</em>. <em>The Pass Machine</em> is the best board review course you can take.  Unlike other courses, <em>The Pass Machine</em> is concise and only goes over what you really need to know for the boards.  I previously took the Mayo Board Review course, which spent too much time reviewing things that were not needed for just taking the boards. I felt like this only made it harder to decide what was pertinent and what was not.  The questions <em>The Pass Machine</em> gave to review were great for cardiology board preparation.  I would highly recommend <em>The Pass Machine</em> as the only concise board review for the Cardiology boards.“<br />
<strong>Jeffrey W. Bissing, DO, Shawnee Mission, KS</strong></p>
<p>“Your cardiovascular review course was excellent. I used my iPhone/IPad for the video lectures and questions. The speakers provided a great review of the pertinent points tested in the recertification exam. Also, the ability to access the information at any time via IPhone/ iPad made the review course a great learning tool in a busy private practice. The questions were relevant to the boards curriculum and the ability to receive a score analysis helped me focused my study. I recently received the great news that I passed the recertification exam and I thank you for helping me reach my professional goals.”<br />
<strong>Dan Deac, MD, FACC, West Palm Beach, FL</strong></p>
<p>“A superb, focused overview of cardiology with emphasis on board-relevant material while maintaining relevance to clinical practice.”<br />
<strong>Paul Kim, MD, Greenwood, SC</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve been to all the review courses through the years – ACEF, Mayo, Cleveland Clinic – and by far this was the best. The repetition, interdisciplinary approach to the program was excellent. All guideline-oriented – great job!”<br />
<strong>Carl Thurmond, MD, Columbia, SC</strong></p>
<p>“The course was great! The info presented was pertinent to the board exam. I am on a 3rd time recert, and it’s the best board review I ever attended. Information is also very pertinent to daily practice of cardiology.”<br />
<strong>Joseph Pedone, MD, Niceville, FL</strong></p>
<p>“This course is excellent, as well as superior to any board review courses I’ve taken in the past! This course is driven to help you and guide you for the boards. Would highly recommend anyone to be part of this experience – you will never regret it.”<br />
<strong>Orlando Almanza, MD, Miami, FL</strong></p>
