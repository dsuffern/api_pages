            <p>If your Cardiovascular Disease Maintenance of Certification Exam takes place in 2014, now there’s absolutely no reason for you to go into the exam without knowing how well you’ll do. If you’ve gotten this far in your medical career with the
                degree of success you’ve had, you’re probably not the type of person who leaves crucial things to chance.</p>
            <p>In the past, you’ve had no choice but to take your Cardio boards blind, so to speak.</p>
            <p>I’m happy to inform you that a <span style="color:#009ee0">FREE Practice Test</span> is now available that makes the “hope-for-the-best” and “don’t-really-know-what-to-expect” approach a thing of the past. The new assessment was developed specifically
                for the Cardiovascular Disease MOC board exam. This 70-question practice test is designed to reflect the exact topic areas in the right proportions of the ABIM<sup>®</sup> exam blueprint. Further, each practice question is designed to reflect
                the style of the questions on your upcoming board exam.</p>
            <p>Thus, after a few minutes, you’ll have a realistic assessment of how well prepared you are overall, and which specific topic areas need additional review before your exam. Remember, the Cardiovascular Disease MOC exam tests you on all aspects
                of cardiology, not just the areas of focus in your medical practice.</p>
            <p>Now, you may ask, what’s in it for American Physician Institute to offer you such a great service at no cost? The answer is simple. As more Cardiologists learn about <em>The Pass Machine</em> Cardiovascular Disease Board Review, the course will
                enjoy even greater success. Undoubtedly, many doctors who take advantage of our free assessment will find it very valuable, and will decide to invest in our full board review course. But, I’ll respect your decision and wish you the best
                on your exam, whether or not you later choose to take <em>The Pass Machine</em> board review course.</p>
            <p>That’s a decision for a later day. Right now, please take advantage of this free assessment. I truly believe it will be an invaluable – perhaps even eye-opening – experience for you. A small time investment with a big payoff!</p>
            <p>Without further delay, please submit the form at right to access your free assessment. You’ll be glad you did!</p>
            <p>To your exam success,</p>

            <p><em>The Pass Machine</em> course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review. It comes in two versions – Online and Live – to match your personal learning style and your schedule:</p>

            <h2>START STUDYING NOW</h2>

                            <li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled
                                to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.
                            <li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.
