<br>
<h2 style="margin-left:37px">WANT PEACE OF MIND? PASS YOUR EXAM THE FIRST TIME<br> – GUARANTEED!</h2>
</div>
<div id="divider" class="shadow"></div>
<!--  Sales Box *********************  --> 
<div id="block" class="parts">
<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>Imagine the peace of mind you’ll experience once this immense exam is over and you’ve successfully certified. I’m happy to tell you that this significant moment is closer – and easier to achieve – than you might think. <em>The Pass Machine®</em> online course is a proven, comprehensive, and laser-focused board review course. Hundreds of doctors have used this course to prepare for and successfully pass their Sleep Medicine Certification Exam. Here’s how it works:</p> 

<!-- Start of Left column ******************* -->
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="photoleft">
<img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/lecturing.jpg" width="238" height="190" alt="Binder" style="border-radius:3px;margin:30px auto 0" />
</div>
<h2>High-Yield Content</h2>
<ul class="sl">
<li><strong>Laser-Focused Lectures: </strong> Content strictly follows the Sleep Medicine Certification exam blueprint. You review only what’s expected on your exam and nothing else.</li>
<li><strong>The “QBL” Method:</strong> To ensure pinpoint exam relevancy, the lectures use a method called “Question-Based Learning.” Lectures are constructed from a series of board-style multiple choice questions, each coupled to a mini-lecture on that question’s topic.</li>
<li><strong>Board-Experienced Faculty:</strong> Lectures are presented by faculty experienced in teaching for board preparation. The two levels of medical editing ensure every lecture is up-to-date, medically accurate and 100% board-relevant.</li>
<li><strong>CME Accreditation:</strong> Earn 30.25 AMA/PRA Category 1 CME Credit(s)™ by participating.</li>
</ul>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="photoleft"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/ipad-an1.png" width="248" height="190" alt="iPhone App" /></div>
<h2>Anytime, Anywhere Access</h2>
<ul class="sl">
<li><strong>Always-on Convenience:</strong> <em>The Pass Machine</em> course is optimized for 24/7 online access from any computer, smartphone, or tablet device, including the iPad®, so you can watch the lectures and take practice exams whenever you have a free moment.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed Printed Syllabus:</strong> The large course syllabus is included with every live and online course. It includes all the course lecture material, including lecture images, presented in a highly organized format.  This way it’s easy to follow along with the live and recorded lectures, and can also be used independently of the lectures as a high-yield written resource.</li>
<li><strong>Audio-Based Lectures:</strong> Audio from each live course lecture is recorded and uploaded onto your course dashboard, providing you flexibility to listen and review course topics while
driving and exercising.</li>
</ul>
<div id="divider" class="yellowline"></div>
<div class="photoleft"><img src="http://thepassmachine.com/images/monitor-lecture.jpg" width="248" height="275" alt="Browser Window" /></div>

<h2>Board-style Practice Exams</h2>
<ul class="sl">
<li><strong>Deep Question Bank:</strong> Test your exam preparedness with hundreds of exam-style multiple-choice questions (MCQ). Questions carefully follow the board content outline, so each one is relevant to your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Realistic Test Environment:</strong> Your patients test you every day – but not in the same way the boards test you. Learn how to answer questions in the board exam format. It’s as close as you can get to the real exam!</li>
<li><strong>Optimized for Learning:</strong> The MCQs include detailed, referenced explanations. That way you’re not just testing your knowledge – you’re learning the “how” and “why” behind every board-style question.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ When Do I Receive Online Access To Review Course Materials?</strong>

<div class="accordionContent">You receive password-protected access to your API online dashboard within one day of registration, excluding federal holidays.

<div class="accordionContent">If you purchase the online course, the syllabus is shipped to you via UPS the next business day after your order is received by API.

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What If I'm Not Ready To Take My Exam? Can I Extend My Course?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Some doctors invest in a board-preparation course many years prior to their exam. In these cases, course registrants can extend the life of their course for 12 additional months at a reduced tuition rate. If you wish to extend your course, please call 1-877-225-8384 prior to your course expiration date.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Are The Benefits Of The Live Course?</strong>

Additionally, it provides you opportunity to interact with expert faculty and your peers. To support your board preparation during and long after the live event, you also receive online access to a recorded version of all lectures starting the first day of the live event.</div>

<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>General Questions About The Triple Trust Guarantee</h2></p>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ This Guarantee Sounds Too Good To Be True—Is It For Real?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes, it’s completely real. Rest assured, API has always honored its guarantees and always will. When you register for the course, you receive a registration packet with your course information that includes a copy of the Triple Trust Guarantee, along with straightforward information on all of the <a href="triple-trust-terms.html">Terms &amp; Conditions</a> that apply. Why does API have such a guarantee when no other company does?  The Triple Trust Guarantee is API’s way of demonstrating that it’s just as invested in your success as you are. After all, if you fail your board exam, API will pay a penalty. API will refund your course tuition in full, provide you with a bonus, and allow you continued access to the course tuition-free until you pass your exam for as long as the exam is offered by the certifying board. The guarantee ensures API doesn’t get paid for effort, only for results.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you purchase a course with a “Triple Trust Guarantee” and do not pass your board exam, API will refund 100% of your course tuition and pay you an additional $500. Additionally, if you purchase the online course, your access to the online course will be extended an additional year, and then extended for one year each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. If you purchase the live course, you may attend one upcoming live course each subsequent time you take and fail the exam. The guarantee expires in the event the exam for which this course is designed is no longer offered by the certifying board. </div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover Non-Tuition Course Options and Upgrades?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. Course options and upgrades are non-tuition related. Therefore, these fees are not included in any guarantee-related refund payment made under the terms of the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Does The Triple Trust Guarantee Cover The Mobile Learning Package?</strong>
</div>
<div class="accordionContent">No. The Mobile Learning Package is a $500 stipend in the form of a Best Buy<sup>®</sup> Gift Card. The Gift Card is to be used to purchase the iPad or other mobile device of your choice. The Mobile Learning Package is non-refundable and is not covered by the Triple Trust Guarantee.</div>
<p class="faq-category-header"><h2>General Questions About The Pass Machine</h2>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Sets <em>The Pass Machine</em> Board Review Courses Apart From Other Courses?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">There are three main differences.<br />
<ol>
	<li><em>The Pass Machine</em> Courses  are not just general reviews—they’re tailored specifically to the topics and  approaches you need to know to pass your exams.</li>
    <li>Each Course is a full preparation system that  includes hundreds of MCQs, online lecture review, mobile lecture review, and a  hard copy of the Course syllabus.</li>
    <li><em>The Pass Machine</em> demonstrates  its confidence in its Courses and commitment to your success by offering you  this Triple Trust Guarantee: if you don’t pass your exam, you get <strong>your Course tuition back</strong>, <strong>PLUS </strong>$500, <strong>PLUS </strong>you get to retake the Course for <strong>FREE</strong> until you do pass.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Who Produces This Sleep Medicine Certification Review Course? Where Do You Get Your Faculty?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent"><em>The Pass Machine</em> Sleep Medicine Certification Course is produced by <em>American  Physician Institute</em>. <em>API </em>conducts dozens of Courses and trains  thousands of physicians each year to pass their boards and stay up-to-date in  their fields.  Every single one of <em>American Physician Institute</em>’s  educational courses has full editorial independence, is free of pharmaceutical  and industry sponsorship and is backed by an unbeatable guarantee.

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Do You Provide Reviews For Boards Other Than Sleep Medicine Certification?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">Yes! In fact, we provide preparation for dozens  of other specialty and subspecialty board exams. Check out <a href="http://www.AmericanPhysician.com" target="_blank">www.AmericanPhysician.com</a> for the full list.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Is It Likely That My Employer Will Cover My Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">You may be surprised at how many residency and  fellowship training programs, group practices, and other employers pay for or  reimburse you for Category 1 educational activities. After all, it’s in  everyone’s best interests to have you board certified. It really pays to ask  your training director, medical director or administrator if you are eligible  because some training programs and employers do pay for board exam training.  And, if you work for the Federal Government, <em>American Physician Institute </em>is  a certified business in the CCR database and can accept government checks and  credit cards.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ Can I Get A Discount For The Course Tuition?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent"><em>American Physician Institute </em>offers  group discounts for residents and fellows and individual discounts through our  Ambassador Club (see below). Please call 877-225-8384 for more information on  these discounts.</div>

<div class="accordionButton"><strong>+ What Is The Ambassador Club? How Does It Work?</strong></div>
<div class="accordionContent">When you register, you automatically become a  member of the <em>American Physician Institute </em>Ambassador Club, which helps  your colleagues benefit from your prep Course experience. If your colleagues  mention your name when they call to register, they’ll each receive a $52  discount on their first Course registration and you’ll receive a $52 check.  <br />
  <br />
  Why $52? <em>API </em>recognizes that your  referral saves about $104 in advertising costs, and they think it’s only fair  to pass those savings along to both of you. There’s no limit to the goodwill  and gratitude you’ll inspire among your colleagues, and there’s no limit to how  many colleagues you can refer. You can make referrals across specialties, too!
